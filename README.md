[Resume (Updated February 2026)](https://ryangomberg.github.io/ryangomberg/RyanGombergResumeFeb2026.pdf)

Welcome to my webpage! I recently graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics at UC Irvine. Refer to the above links for my resume and work/projects! 

My current interests are in Data Science/Machine Learning combined with Actuarial Sciences! With a strong foundation in applied mathematics and hands-on experience in machine learning (through academic projects), I bring both analytical rigor and practical coding ability to team-based projects. I am eager to leverage academic experience and contribute to impactful work in a professional environment.

Whenever I have free time, I enjoy swimming, video games, watching shows/movies, and taking walks on the beach! :)

Thank you for visiting my page and feel free to connect!

## Goals and Plans

Since the completion of my Bachelor's Degree at UC Irvine, I would like to acquire at experience in the industry (ideally related to machine learning/finance/actuary), whether it be through internships or jobs, before considering a Master's program in Applied Mathmatics at San Diego State University or University of California, San Diego. These colleges were chosen for the ease of commuting and, additionally, both offer exceptional and rigorous programs for Applied Mathematics and Statistics. A thorough cost-benefit analysis was also considered, ensuring that a Master's degree is a reasonable financial investment for what I would get out of it. In the meantime, I would like to take on other projects for personal interest, namely related to machine learning practices, understanding databases, and learning visualization tools. I recently took SOA Exam P (with a preliminary passing score) and will be taking FM and SRM before summer!

A brief (and ideal) timeline can be summarized by the following roadmap:
- Fall 2025 - Summer 2026: Take SOA Exams; work at an internship program and/or entry-level job OR work on self-motivated projects.
- Fall 2026+: Continue working (if applicable) or start a Master's program at SDSU or UCSD. Participate in any university driven research in Applied Mathematics.

By taking SOA Exams, I would be better prepared to assume an Acturial or Data Analyst/Scientist position, which will be supported by my skills in programming (MATLAB/Python/R).

More broadly, I wish to develop a well-rounded foundation in both analytic and technical skills while opening myself to as many opportunities as possible--without stretching myself too thin.

#### Technical Skills: R, MATLAB, Python, Excel, LaTeX

## Work and Volunteer Experience

**Mentor | Math CEO (Organization) @ UC Irvine (_January 2024 - April 2024_)**
- Engaged with high school students in low-income, diverse areas in inquiry-based activities with a strong emphasis on mathematics and other topics in STEM
- Collaborated with other mentors in curating new activities and maintaining student involvement
- Led group activities and encouraged conversation through icebreaker questions, active listening, and by introducing new ideas
- Learned how to partition challenging concepts into smaller, digestible problems

**Self-employed | Private Tutoring | San Diego, CA (_September 2020 - June 2021_)**
- Provided one-on-one instruction to middle and high school students to prepare for academic tests and improve academic performance in mathematics
- Prepared lessons and supplements to monitor and assess student progress
- Developed study strategies and time management skills depending on each student’s needs and learning styles
- Demonstrated various problem-solving methods to allow better understanding of a concept
- Helped three students achieve their academic goal

## Recent Personal Initiatives/Projects

**Pricing and Severity Modeling Project** (December 2025 - January 2026)
- Simulated a dataset in R to model policyholder characteristics and used Exploratory Data Analysis to verify and explore trends.
- Implemented GLMs and regression models to approximate claim frequency and average claim severity. Ran diagonistics for statistical significance and goodness of fit over all models. More specifically, Poisson GLM and Negative Binomial for claim frequency and Gamma GLM, Lognormal, Weibull, Exponential for average severity.
- Interpreted both model archetypes individually as well as their combined effect on total losses, both conceptually and quantitatively.
- Developed interactive Excel dashboards to visualize relationships between prospective pricing models andhistorical claim data.
- Synthesized insights into a PowerPoint presentation to communicate data-driven recommendations for pricing premiums to policyholders.

**Quantitative Analysis Project** (May 2025)
- Given recent OHLCV price history data in the S&P 500 index, identified equity factors and reasonable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) while providing reasons for their individual strengths and weaknesses
- Applied a risk-adjusted backtester to measure risk on historical data, using important metrics such as an Annualized Sharpe Ratio, Portfolio Return, and Cumulative Return
- Found that a 3-month Momentum strategy has weak predictive power due do its consistently negative Sharpe Ratio and general downward trend of return, thus concluding that this strategy is not apt for portfolio investors
- Suggested a potential option for binary regression modeling which tells investors whether they should invest in an asset based on factors such as KPIs or other previously mentioned metrics
- The report was developed in Python and exported through LaTeX

**Recommendation System Case Study** (May 2025)
- Developed a report highlighting a recommendation system for Netflix movies based on two different user diagnostics
- Applied multiple preprocessing strategies (standardization, merging, dropping values, sorting) and Exploratory Data Analysis to identity early trends within the aggregate data
- Used Cosine Similarity to output movie recommendations whose description closely matches the input
- Constructed a Recurrent Neural Network to output a movie recommendation based on the users viewing history
- Analyzed results and suggested areas for improvement

**Notes: Mathematics of Finance and Machine Learning (_January 2025 - April 2025_)**
- Compiled and formatted 50-page notes for two classes with formatted chapters using LaTeX
- Designed self-curated diagrams and plots to accompany relevant material through PowerPoint and MATLAB
- Applied research, organization, and technical writing skills for a well-structured comprehensive study tool
- Publicized my work on GitHub should anyone wish to access and/or recreate diagrams or plots

**Machine Learning on Adult Census Income Dataset (_January 2025 - March 2025_)**
- Developed a report, following PEP8 style guidelines, on machine learning algorithms designed to predict and identify trends within a U.S. census dataset
- Applied Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods to predict a U.S. citizen's annual income, obtaining 82% and 86% accuracy.
- Used PCA to determine a proportion of explained variance between features
- Employed k-fold cross-validation to generate multiple subsets of models


Within these projects, I demonstrated an understanding of using Python as a programming language, LaTeX as a word processing software, and MATLAB to generate models and plots. Moreover, I have strengthened my quantitative understanding in finance and machine learning in a pratical setting.
