[Resume (Updated March 2025)](https://ryangomberg.github.io/ryangomberg/RyanGombergResume.pdf)

Welcome to my webpage! I am an Undergraduate Applied/Computational Mathematics Major at UC Irvine, graduating Spring 2025. Refer to the above links for my resume and work/projects! 

My current interests have been in Data Science/Machine Learning and Finance! I have experience with working and handling projects in a personal and team setting, as well as managing timelines and task coordination. I am keen to leverage academic experience and contribute to successful projects in a professional environment.

#### Technical Skills: R, MATLAB, Python, Excel, LaTeX

## Education
- B.S., Applied and Computational Mathematics | University of California, Irvine (_Expected June 2025_)
- Cumulative GPA: 3.49
- Made the Deans Honor List 7 times
- Relevant Coursework: Mathematical Machine Learning, Statistics for Data Science, Numerical Analysis, Mathematics of Finance, Fixed Income, Probability, Technical Writing
  
## Work and Volunteer Experience

**Mentor | Math CEO (Organization) @ UC Irvine (_January 2024 - April 2024_)**
- Engaged with high school students in low-income, diverse areas in inquiry-based activities with a strong emphasis on mathematics and other topics in STEM
- Collaborated with other mentors in curating new activities and maintaining student involvement
- Led group activities and encouraged conversation through icebreaker questions, active listening, and by introducing new ideas
- Learned how to partition challenging concepts into smaller, digestible problems

**Self-employed | Private Tutoring | San Diego, CA (_September 2020 - June 2021_)**
- Provided one-on-one instruction to middle and high school students to prepare for academic tests and improve academic performance in mathematics
- Prepared lessons and supplements to monitor and assess student progress
- Developed study strategies and time management skills depending on each student’s needs and learning styles
- Demonstrated various problem-solving methods to allow better understanding of a concept
- Helped three students achieve their academic goal

## Personal Initiatives/Projects
**Notes: Mathematics of Finance and Machine Learning (_January 2025 - Present_)**
- Compiled and formatted 50-page notes for two classes with formatted chapters using LaTeX
- Designed self-curated diagrams and plots to accompany relevant material through PowerPoint and MATLAB
- Applied research, organization, and technical writing skills for a well-structured comprehensive study tool
- Publicized my work on GitHub should anyone wish to access and/or recreate diagrams or plots

**Machine Learning on Adult Census Income Dataset (_January 2025 - March 2025_)**
- Developed a report, following PEP8 style guidelines, on machine learning algorithms designed to predict and identify trends within a U.S. census dataset
- Applied Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods to predict a U.S. citizen's annual income, obtaining 82% and 86% accuracy.
- Used PCA to determine a proportion of explained variance between features
- Employed k-fold cross-validation and bootstrapping to generate multiple subsets of models

**Predicting Interest in Vehicle Insurance (_January 2023 - March 2023_)**
-	Implemented unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms to predict a consumer’s interest in vehicle insurance based on 10 different features
-	Imported large scale data and applied statistical models to determine the strength of correlation between two or more factors
-	Identified the strengths and problems within each algorithm, and proposed ways to improve them
-	Analytically derived and offered mathematical intuition behind each model
-	Supervised learning models achieved 86-88% accuracy

Within these projects, I demonstrated an elementary understanding of using Python/SQL as a programming language, LaTeX as a word processing software, and MATLAB to generate models and plots.
