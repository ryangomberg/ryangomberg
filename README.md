[Resume (Updated April 2025)](https://ryangomberg.github.io/ryangomberg/RyanGombergResumeApril2025.pdf)

Welcome to my webpage! I am an Undergraduate Applied/Computational Mathematics Major at UC Irvine, graduating June 2025. Refer to the above links for my resume and work/projects! 

My current interests are in Data Science/Machine Learning and Finance! With a strong foundation in applied mathematics and hands-on experience in machine learning (through academic projects), I bring both analytical rigor and practical coding ability to team-based projects. I am eager to leverage academic experience and contribute to impactful work in a professional environment.

Whenever I have free time, I enjoy swimming, video games, watching shows/movies, and taking walks on the beach! :)

Thank you for visiting my page and feel free to connect!

## Goals and Plans

Upon completion of my Bachelor's Degree at UC Irvine, I would like to acquire at least 1 year of experience in the industry (ideally related to machine learning/finance), whether it be through internships or jobs, before considering a Master's program in Applied Mathmatics at San Diego State University or University of California, San Diego. These colleges were chosen for the ease of commuting and, additionally, both offer exceptional and rigorous programs for Applied Mathematics and Statistics. A thorough cost-benefit analysis was also considered, ensuring that a Master's degree is a reasonable financial investment for what I would get out of it. In the meantime, I would like to take on other projects for personal interest, namely related to machine learning practices, understanding databases, and learning visualization tools. If time allows, I would like to take 1-2 SOA Exams (Probability and Statistics for Risk Modeling preferred) in the summer and fall of this year.

A brief (and ideal) timeline can be summarized by the following roadmap:
- Now: Look into internship and/or work opportunities. Work on side-projects.
- Summer 2025: If applicable, work at an internship program and/or entry-level job. Work on side-projects and prepare for SOA Exams.
- Fall 2025 - Summer 2026: Take SOA Exams; work at an internship program and/or entry-level job.
- Fall 2026+: Continue working, or start a Master's program at SDSU or UCSD. Participate in any university driven research in Applied Mathematics.

By taking SOA Exams, I would be better prepared to assume an Acturial or Accounting position, which will be supported by my skills in programming (MATLAB/Python/R).

One small project I have just started undertaking is to model a Boolean Neural Network using PyTorch, and using Neural Networks on the MNIST Image Processing Dataset. 
Afterward, I would also like to work on a large dataset that culminates data querying (SQL), exploratory data analysis, machine learning practices, and summarizing my findings using visualization software. This work reinforces my knowledge of SQL and Python, as alluded to in the Technical Skills Section. Ultimately, these projects will further prepare myself for more topics and needs in machine learning/data science and improves my ability to learn techniques on my own. 

More broadly, I wish to develop a well-rounded foundation in both analytic and technical skills while open myself to as many opportunities as possible--without stretching myself too thin.

#### Technical Skills: R, MATLAB, Python, Excel, LaTeX

## Personal Initiatives/Projects

**Research - Algebraic Geometry (_March 2025 - June 2025_)**

**Notes: Mathematics of Finance and Machine Learning (_January 2025 - April 2025_)**
- Compiled and formatted 50-page notes for two classes with formatted chapters using LaTeX
- Designed self-curated diagrams and plots to accompany relevant material through PowerPoint and MATLAB
- Applied research, organization, and technical writing skills for a well-structured comprehensive study tool
- Publicized my work on GitHub should anyone wish to access and/or recreate diagrams or plots

**Machine Learning on Adult Census Income Dataset (_January 2025 - March 2025_)**
- Developed a report, following PEP8 style guidelines, on machine learning algorithms designed to predict and identify trends within a U.S. census dataset
- Applied Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods to predict a U.S. citizen's annual income, obtaining 82% and 86% accuracy.
- Used PCA to determine a proportion of explained variance between features
- Employed k-fold cross-validation to generate multiple subsets of models

**Predicting Interest in Vehicle Insurance (_January 2023 - March 2023_)**
-	Implemented unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms to predict a consumer’s interest in vehicle insurance based on 10 different features
-	Imported large scale data and applied statistical models to determine the strength of correlation between two or more factors
-	Identified the strengths and problems within each algorithm, and proposed ways to improve them
-	Analytically derived and offered mathematical intuition behind each model
-	Supervised learning models achieved 86-88% accuracy

Within these projects, I demonstrated an understanding of using Python as a programming language, LaTeX as a word processing software, and MATLAB to generate models and plots.
